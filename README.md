👋 Hi, my name is Gianpaulo. However, most people call me Gian. 

📚 I am currently pursuing a double degree in Business Administration and Computer Science, making me a student at both Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Waterloo.

🔎 My short-term goal as of now is to land a co-op placement for Winter 2023

💪 My strength stems from how versatile I am. I do well in support roles because I always think ahead to see how I can go above and beyond for those I am supporting, and I also do well in leadership roles because of my ability to establish productive yet fun environments in teams that I lead.

🔮 My long-term goal is to develop a diverse skillset within the realms of Business and Computer Science, allowing me to be versatile and make an impact in whatever role I am placed in.
